How do our Brains work - Artifical Neural Networks

- [ ] 1. What is a Neural Network?
- Computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in our brain
- The branches on the neurons recieve the signals, when stimulated it fires the signal through its axom
- Our sensors send signals to some neurons that pass it to the brain, 
- The brain then processes the signal and sends it to the muscles to move (some neurons fire, some don't)

- [ ] 2. Our Cars Neural Network

- neurons on the first layer will be connected with the sensors
- they will send signals forward a few times
- The last layer will be connected to the car controls to make it do something

- We have levels, each level has a floor, ceiling and connections in between.
- The ceiling of the first floor is the floor of the second floor
